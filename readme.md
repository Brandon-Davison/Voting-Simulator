Good Job Team - Voting System
Cpts 322 Course Project Repo

This is the course project for WSU CPTS 322 Software Design.

The voting system is configurable allowing users to specify candidates, total votes available, date range for voting, and the winning number of votes reaching which the winning candidate 
can be determined without waiting until all votes are casted think about the presidential election process).

This will be an Android app in Java and Android Studio that's robust, user-friendly, and deployable.
The system should include a user interface showing the voting results (e.g., the final votes each candidate received and the winning candidate, 
and possibly the vote statistics by geographic locations or political regions) for which visualizations can be employed to enhance the understanding of results.
